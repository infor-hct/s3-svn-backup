This a tiny backup script I wrote a couple of years ago.
As I'm discontinuing my ancient blog and this article 
still gets a lot of hits from Google, I'm redirecting 
it here for everyone to fork.

For instructions, see INSTRUCTIONS.markdown 
(the original blog post)

You should also check out this modified version which 
has a few more features that my original one:
